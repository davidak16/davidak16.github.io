                <p>Figma brings something new with creative tools now available on the internet. Figma is offering a premium product that can be utilized by a myriad of different users. Figma's story starts back in 2011 when founders Dylan Field and Evan Wallace had a lightbulb. The initial idea came when they posed the question ‚ÄúCan tools for designers be built on the web? ‚ÄúNo need for final versions, people across the world and different time zones could collaborate and of course it would give the average person access to powerful design tools. Before they knew it an experiment in WebGLs proved Figmas validity and led to three more years of intensive work on a vector based design tool.</p>
                <p>In 2015 Figma was born and it was free. Though it took a rocky start, the pros of Figma soon became clear to designers everywhere. Real time collaboration was one of the biggest starters. Additionally, Figma made design accessible to everyone. Companies began adopting Figma to speed up their workflows and it finally allowed people to work together outside work.</p>

                            <p>Figma allows you to easily create website mockups. One of the more obvious advantages Figma is that you don't need to know how to code. You can build a prototype by simply dragging and dropping objects onto the canvas . It has a Simple Interface unlike Photoshop which is difficult to navigate through the interface. Figma is much easier and only requires one click to add an object. It also has responsive designs which allows the program to automatically adjust the layout according to the size of the screen.</p>

                        <li>
                            <h3> WEAKNESSES</h3>
                            <p>Some of the weaknesses found among users have been no version control this makes tracking all of the changes fairy difficult .Another people have noted is limited customization options, while customization is available to an extent people would like to see   custom shapes, gradients, or patterns.No offline work is big while the novelty of Figma lies in it being desktop and cloud based offline work still is an important feature to consider. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3> OPPURTUNITIES</h3>
                            <p>The biggest opportunities for Figma are its Collaboration platform in FigJam and Its Education programs. Since Figma is cloud based, working together with others by sharing your files online is a natural progression and key point of interest. In the future many users have cited a work offline mode Figma currently relies on a internet connection like most desktop apps, compared to some competitors.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3> THREATS</h3>
                            <p>Right now Figma is poised ahead of many of its competitors . In large art due to the adobe acquisition. However it still directly competes with a lot of apps in the adobe suite. Current threats are similar cloud based platforms like Sketch and Canva, but Figma seems the most robust and is accepted as the industry standard in terms of enterprise software.</p>

                            <p>Figma has the option to prototype  and collaboration in case you are working in a team. It's been specifically made for this use case. Whereas canva and sketch seems to be a more general tool with the former being used more for social media graphics. Figma is definitely the all in one industry standard. </p>

                            <p>Sketch and Figma support pages and artboards, although Figma's artboards (or frames) are more flexible because they can be nested. Adobe XD supports only artboards. All three apps let you use grids and column layouts inside artboards. Figma's implementation feels more powerful because you can nest.</p>

                            <p> Figma is preferred due to how it handles components and variants. Being able to see all variants in 1 component at the same time and draw interactions between each variant is big within the design space. Also auto layout is top notch  when doing responsive work. Lastly Figma has a paid and free tier, as opposed to Adobe.</p>

                <p>Their competitive advantage and main advantage is theyre deeply embedded in the workflow of individuals and businesses, making many hesitant to switch. A neutral is that the software typically takes a while to learn, leading to an initial drop-off though this makes customers more hesitant to switch because of time invested. The educational program is also a valuable asset as its gets students studying design into lifetime users. Figma is the Gold Standard, and in most cases, it's better for them to use the most understood software in the market. Because people want to use designers who use Figma and vice versa. Lastly Platform mediated networks and third party tools. Barriers to entry, Barriers to exit. </p>

                        <h5>Cloud Based Browser</h5>
                        <p>Value of Figma is its cloud based software and because you can have people work on the same file at the same time it drastically improves time efficiency. What used to take a couple hours to design out, now takes 30 minutes with multiple people working at the same time. Figma's prototyping is easier to implement. Presenting to clients straight from Figma instead of using Keynote or Powerpoint, then switching windows to the Figma prototype. Slides' are part of prototypes now. Figma has made remote work very easy.</p>

You can do everything in one tool in Figma, from wireframing, UI creating, illustrating, prototyping, and shipping to devs. The observation element, allows for people to follow along and engage with designer in what they're doing in a virtual white boarding session.</p>
